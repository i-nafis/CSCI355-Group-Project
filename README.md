# Convergence Church Website Project

This project was developed as a group project where we reached out to a client and got their approval to build a website for Convergence Church. Our goal was to create an online platform that shares the church's mission, services, and community events.

## Project Overview

The website includes:
- **Home Page:** An inviting introduction and quick navigation.
- **About Page:** Detailed information about the church’s mission, vision, and team.
- **Sunday Service Page:** Information about the corporate gatherings for worship and fellowship.
- **Midweek Gathering Page:** Details about the intimate, community-focused midweek services.

## Client

We partnered with Convergence Church to build this project. Their vision and feedback guided our design and functionality choices.
